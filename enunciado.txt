 Implement the two mandatory "Power-ups" (described below).
• Implement at least two "Power-up" of your choice.
• Implement treasure chests in the game which contain three different weapons/skill
options from which the user must choose.
• Implement at least two new weapons of your choice
• Improve the UI.
• Add an instructions panel to the game where the rules of the game and the "Powerups", Weapons and Treasures are explained to the user.
• Add the functional limitations necessary to make the game operational and aligned
with the goals of the game. For example, The character should not be able to go
outside of the map.
• Give the player the option to shop for new weapons. Thus, a monetary system
must be implemented alongside the option to purchase weapons/abilities.
• Add the saving feature that stores all the progress the player has made.
• Add one extra functionality to the game beyond the game improvements and previously described additions. This functionality needs to be novel and is totally up
to you! This is another great chance to improve the game and impress us!
